* **Tracking Semantic Evolutionary Changes in Large-Scale Medical Knowledge Bases**  
  
  - Developed an advanced reasoning approach to tracking the semantic difference in the meanings of medical terms between different versions of medical knowledge bases.
  - Built a bespoke semantic difference tracking system as part of SNOMED Internationalâ€™s framework for quality control of their medical data.  
  
* **Computing Views of OWL Ontologies for the Semantic Web**  
  
  - Developed a logic-based, principled approach to creating views of OWL ontologies specified in the description logic ALCHOI.
  - Implemented a prototype of the approach, and compared it with existing tools LETHE and FAME, with results showing better success rates and performance.
  
  
* **Adaptive Optimization of Traffic Signal Timing via Deep Reinforcement**  
  
  - Proposed a traffic light timing optimization scheme based on deep reinforcement learning, which dynamically adjusts the green light time and phase at an intersection with the goal of minimizing vehicle delay time.
  - Implemented a deep reinforcement learning network (in Python), and reduced waiting time and average queue length in various traffic flow modes by more than 33.4% compared to the traditional timing control.  
    
    
* **UI-FAME: A High-Performance Forgetting System for~Creating Views of Ontologies**  
  Remotely  
  - Implemented and optimized the UI-FAME system for a non-standard reasoning procedure called forgetting for OWL ontologies specified in the description logic ALC.
  - Designed ontology versioning framework for Babylon ontologies with UI-FAME as back-end, and conducted extensive trials in Babylon set-up with involvement of their software/knowledge engineers.
