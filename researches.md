* **Tracking Semantic Evolutionary Changes in Large-Scale Medical Ontologies**  
  Remotely  
  - Developed a tailor-made uniform interpolation method for the task of computing logical difference in large-scale medical ontologies, serving as back-end technology in digital healthcare providers' knowledge base interface.
  - Identified reasoning focuses and demands, optimized codes for calculating logical difference, and handed over the set-up of the system with Babylon Health.  
  
* **Adaptive Optimization of Traffic Signal Timing via Deep Reinforcement**  
  Beijing University of Technology  
  - Proposed a traffic light timing optimization scheme based on deep reinforcement learning, which dynamically adjusts the green light time and phase at an intersection with the goal of minimizing vehicle delay time.
  - Implemented a deep reinforcement learning network (in Python), and reduced waiting time and average queue length in various traffic flow modes by more than 33.4% compared to the traditional timing control.  
  
* **UI-FAME: A High-Performance Forgetting System for~Creating Views of Ontologies**  
  Remotely  
  - Implemented and optimized the UI-FAME system for creating logical differences in description logic ontologies (in Java), useful for many ontology-based knowledge processing applications.
  - Developed a bespoke ontology analysis tool for the ontology processing and management tasks undertaken in Babylon Health, a digital healthcare company based in London.  
  
* **High-building Cleaning Robot**  
  Beijing University of Technology  
  - Designed the hardware system of the robot which can detect obstacles using infrared range finder and can adjust its speed according to the difference between motors that are equipped on the left and right side of the robot.
  - Developed five core modules of the robot's system (in C), including key module, infrared distance measurement module, communication module, drive circuits module and motors module.
